# Green Bin App

## Overview

Green Bin is a simple web app that helps people figure out how to throw away items the right way. It’s especially helpful during Spring, when people are doing more cleaning and throwing out old stuff.

This app helps reduce waste going to the landfill by teaching people how to recycle properly. It uses real data and AI to give helpful info about what to do with different items.
