# Green Bin App

## Project Overview

The Green Bin App is a smart solution designed to improve waste management by helping users correctly sort their recyclable and compostable waste. It addresses the common problem of contamination in recycling bins, which leads to inefficiencies and increased landfill waste.

By providing clear guidance and real-time feedback, the app encourages proper waste sorting habits, reduces contamination rates, and promotes environmental sustainability.

## Problem Statement

Improper sorting of waste into green bins leads to recyclable materials being discarded as trash, which increases landfill volume and harms the environment. Users often lack accessible information on how to dispose of waste correctly, contributing to this issue.

## Solution

The Green Bin App offers an intuitive interface where users can input or scan items, and the app guides them on whether and how to dispose of those items correctly. Through features such as item recognition, educational content, and reminders, the app empowers users to make environmentally friendly choices easily.

## Impact

- Reduces contamination in recycling and compost bins.
