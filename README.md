# 🌱 Green Bin App

## 🌼 Overview

**Green Bin App** is a web-based solution built to promote **eco-friendly waste disposal habits** this Spring. As the season symbolizes **renewal and growth**, our app encourages individuals and communities to take part in **reviving the planet**—one correctly sorted item at a time.

The app provides users with smart, accessible guidance on how to properly dispose of their waste using AI and real-time data. It helps reduce contamination in recycling and compost bins, ultimately lowering landfill overflow and contributing to a cleaner, greener world.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
